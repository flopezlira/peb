"""
This module defines the states and associated data for a Telegram bot that interacts with
 OpenAI's GPT model.
The bot guides users through various states to collect information and generate a comprehensive
 prompt for the GPT model.

Features:
- Enumerated states: The BotState enum class provides clear, identifiable names for each state in
    the bot's conversation flow.
- State messages: A dictionary mapping each state to its corresponding message prompts, guiding the
    user through the conversation.
- State-specific examples, suggestions, and final messages: Dictionaries containing predefined
    examples,     suggestions, and final messages for each state to enhance the user experience
    and prompt quality.
- State code mapping: A dictionary linking string representations of states to their corresponding
    enum values, facilitating easy state management and reference.

The module is structured to provide all necessary data and configurations for managing the
conversation states in a Telegram bot that interfaces with OpenAI's GPT model.
It includes predefined messages, examples, and guidelines for each state to assist users in
crafting effective prompts for the GPT model.

The module is designed to be imported into a larger Telegram bot application where these states,
messages, and suggestions will be used to guide the conversation and prompt creation process.

Usage:
The module is not a standalone script but is intended to be imported and utilized as part of
    a Telegram bot application.
The BotState enum and associated dictionaries should be used to manage and respond to user
interactions within the bot.

Example:
    from this_module import BotState, state_code, state_message
    current_state = BotState.START
    print(state_message[current_state])

Note:
- The module assumes that the Telegram bot and OpenAI GPT integration are handled in another part
    of the application.
- It's important to update the examples, suggestions, and messages as per the specific needs and
    context of the bot.
