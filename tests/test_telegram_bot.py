"""
Unit Testing Module for Telegram Bot

This module contains unit tests for a Telegram bot that interacts with users and processes their
requests using OpenAI's GPT model. The tests focus on the bot's conversation states, ensuring the
correct flow and response handling. External dependencies, such as the Telegram Bot API and OpenAI
API, are mocked to isolate and test the internal logic of the bot.

The tests utilize `pytest` as the testing framework and `unittest.mock` for mocking external
services. Each function in the bot is tested individually to validate its behavior in different
scenarios.

Key Components:
- pytest: For writing and running the unit tests.
- unittest.mock: For mocking external API calls and interactions.
- Test cases: Covering each state handling function in the bot.

Usage:
Run these tests using a pytest runner to validate the bot's functionality.

Dependencies:
- pytest
- unittest.mock
- python-telegram-bot

def test_start_function(mocker):
    """
        Test the 'start' function of the Telegram bot.

        This test simulates the '/start' command being sent to the bot and asserts the response.
        The test ensures that the bot transitions to the 'GOAL' state upon receiving
        the '/start' command and that it sends the correct welcome message to the user.

        Parameters:
        - mocker (pytest.fixture): The pytest mocker fixture used to mock the reply_text method.

        The Update and CallbackContext objects from the Telegram bot API are mocked to simulate
        the interaction without actual network calls. The result and behavior of the 'start'
        function are then asserted to ensure the correct functionality.

        Asserts:
        - The returned state is BotState.GOAL.
        - The bot sends the correct welcome message to the user.
